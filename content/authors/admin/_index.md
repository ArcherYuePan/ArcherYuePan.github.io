With a background in psychology, I am passionate about identifying and studying behavioral inconsistencies in the marketplace. I explore these inconsistencies across various situations and different consumer groups. My job market paper examines the heterogeneity in consumer acceptance of AI products and services, addressing the question: Why are consumers in Eastern countries more willing to adopt AI products compared to those in Western countries? In another research project, I investigate why some consumers are keen to negotiate prices while others avoid it. Additionally, I am committed to research that enhances societal welfare. My ongoing projects include studies on charitable donations, misinformation, consumption happiness, and investment decisions.

I am currently on the 2024-2025 job market.
