With a background in psychology, I have a passion for identifying behavioral inconsistencies in the marketplace and leveraging them to develop insightful research questions. One of my dissertation projects, for instance, examines the variations in consumer acceptance of AI products and services. Another project provides insights into why some consumers are more inclined to negotiate prices than others. I am particularly enthusiastic about using my research to enhance individual and societal well-being. Through additional projects on charitable donations, misinformation, consumption happiness, and investment decisions, I aim to use marketing as a tool to empower consumers, marketers, and policymakers.

I am currently on the 2024-2025 job market.
