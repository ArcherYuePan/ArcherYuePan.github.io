I am a consumer behavior researcher focusing on three research topics: human-technology interaction, language and psycholinguistics, and consumer values and beliefs. As a tech enthusiast, I am particularly interested in understanding the factors driving technology adoption, the influence of technology on daily life, and the implications of technology-related policies. My job market paper, for example, explores cultural differences in consumers' propensity to adopt AI-branded products. Additionally, as a bilingual, I investigate how using a non-native versus native language influences bilinguals' cognitive processes and decision-making, as well as how different framings of marketing metrics affect marketing judgments and decisions. Lastly, driven by a deep interest in how individual values and beliefs shape behavior, my research examines how market ideology impacts consumers' decisions to engage in price negotiations, and proposes a new framework for understanding the influence of consumption on consumer well-being.

Before beginning my doctoral studies in marketing at Cornell University's SC Johnson Graduate School of Management, I worked as a research assistant and interim lab manager at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I also completed two years of doctoral training at Northwestern University's School of Communication. I hold a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a master's degree in social sciences from the University of Chicago.

Growing up in a family of teachers, I initially believed I would pursue a career in history education before discovering my passion for consumer psychology.

I am currently on the 2024-2025 job market.
